## Tools

### TRASH: Tandem Repeat Annotation and Structural Hierarchy 
TRASH (Tandem Repeat Annotation and Structural Hierarchy) is a bioinformatics tool designed for the identification, extraction, and analysis of tandem repeats within genomic sequences. This tool is particularly effective in detecting and characterizing higher-order repeat structures, which are critical for understanding genomic organization and function.

#### Key Features:
- Local K-mer Counting: TRASH uses a local k-mer counting approach to identify regions of the genome that are rich in repeated sequences. This method allows for the precise detection of tandem repeats.
- Periodicity and Consensus Sequence Identification: The tool calculates the periodicity of detected tandem repeats and constructs a consensus sequence, providing a comprehensive map of repeat units.
- Higher Order Repeat (HOR) Detection: TRASH can identify higher-order repeats by analyzing pairs of repeat blocks with high similarity, which is crucial for studying complex genomic structures such as satellite DNA.
- Multithreading Support: The tool supports multithreading, enabling the efficient processing of large genomic datasets by utilizing multiple cores.
Customizable Parameters: TRASH offers a wide range of customizable parameters, allowing users to fine-tune the analysis to meet specific research needs.
